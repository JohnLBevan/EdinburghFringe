# EdinburghFringe

NB: This project has no official relationship to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

An API, site and related App for providing convenient event information; initially targeting the Edinburgh Fringe, but with the aim to later be reusable by other events.

Having used the existing, official Fringe app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.edfringe.festivalapp) I noticed a number of deficiencies / thought it would be good to create a community app which addresses some of those issues / can be an alternative to the official app.  Additionally, I'd like to make this app reusable by other festivals and events organisers; either by taking the framework and adding their own branding and events, or simply by adding their data to this project's instance and allowing users to subscribe to their festival/collection.  

Initially this GitHub project will just host a brainstorm of thoughts & requirements as I focus on development of other projects & build up a more comprehensive picture of this project.

I'm keen  for other members of the community to get involved; though suspect that will only begin once I progress with the core development.

The technologies I'm likely to use are: 
- ASP.Net MVC for site & OData web services
- Xamarin for Android and iOS apps
